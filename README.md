## Donut Form exercise

As you can see you have a donut component is already ready for you. it's getting renderd using the Donuts component state as you can see in the `src/container/donuts/index.js`, your job is to implement a form that includes:

- Donut's name
- Flavor (Select tag that includes atleast 3 options )
- Topping (Multiple selector tag that includes any topping you would like to have avaiable for your customer)
- Recommended ? (Check box that if checked it will set isLiked state to true in order to show that this donut is awesome!)

When a user Submits the form it should add a new element in the donutsMenu state which will cause a new donut to be renderd
